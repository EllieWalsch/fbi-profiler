# FBI Profiler

## Description

This program is a personality profiling tool that allows a user to better understand their peers. The user will create profiles for subjects and be given the option to ask four different types of questions that will help determine a profile type. Answers will be graded on a scale of -5 to 5 to judge the subject's receptiveness. Scores will be saved on each subject's profile along with their personality type and graph. 

## Usage

Begin by creating an account or logging in. The homepage will display all the user's subjects and their average scores. When a subject is clicked, a chart of their personality traits will generate along with their overall personality type. There will also be an option to ask different categories of questions to judge that specific trait. Users may rate the response on a sliding scale below. 

The Charts page will compare all subjects and their scores for each personality trait.
